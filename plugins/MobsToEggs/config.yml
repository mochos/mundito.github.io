global-values:
  # Should mob eggs be allowed to change the mob spawner type when a spawner is right-clicked?
  # This is useful if you have other plugins that handle spawner changing.
  # Note: you won't be able to save mob data on a spawner when this is set false.
  change-spawners: true
  # If you don't have a permissions plugin installed, you can set use-permissions as false to ignore all user-based permission checks.
  # Note: Some plugin features are locked behind permissions for security purposes. If you have use-permissions false, these locked features can only be accessed by OP players.
  use-permissions: true
# Periodically check if there is a new update for Mobs To Eggs. This will send a message to the console when an update is found.
check-for-updates: true
# If your 'projectile-type' below is set as an "Egg", this option allows you to allow/deny baby chickens from hatching when a chicken egg is thrown.
# Note: This will disable baby chicken hatching from ALL thrown chicken eggs when set false.

#   Catch Capsule Modifications   #
###################################
# Here you can edit the catch capsule to create a custom projectile to throw at mobs to catch them in mob spawn eggs.
# projectile-type = The projectile that is collected and thrown
# item = The item the catch capsule will appear as when thrown.
# data = CustomModelData for a resource pack. Set to '-1' if you don't use it.
# name = "the name of the catch capsule" (colour codes supported).
# lore = the description (lore) placed on the item.
# Example:
#  capsule:
#   projectile-type: Egg
#   item: Egg
#   data: 1234567
#   name: "&aA green egg"
#   lore: ["&cLore line 1", "&6Lore line 2", "&eLore line 3", "etc"]
capsule:
  projectile-type: Snowball
  item: Snowball
  data: -1
  name: '&6&lCapturador de criaturas'
  lore: ["&7Capturar criaturas de dos formas:", "&7Lanzar con clic derecho", "&7Golpear con clic"]
# You can create a custom crafting recipe for the capsule.
capsule-crafting-recipe:
  # Do you want to use the crafting recipe for your capsule?
  # You will need to restart your server if you change this value.
  use-capsule-crafting-recipe: false
  # Here you can define how the recipe looks in your crafting table. Each new line is a crafting table slot going from left to right with a max of 9 slots.
  # If you want the slot to be blank, set it to "Air".
  # The default shape would look like this (using the 1st letter of each item):
  # A E A
  # E G E
  # E E E
  recipe-shape:
  - Air
  - Egg
  - Air
  - Egg
  - Gold_Ingot
  - Egg
  - Egg
  - Egg
  - Egg
  # This value lets you change how many capsules will you receive when crafting.

#   Capsule Throwing Behaviour   #
##################################
# You can change the ways that you use your capture capsule to catch mobs.
# throw = launching the capture capsule at the mob as a projectile (such as throwing an egg).
# punch = punch (left-click) the mob with the capture capsule to catch it.
# You can have all catch methods set true, but you cannot have all set false.
catch-method:
  throw: true
  punch: true
# If you have 'throw: false' set above, then nothing below will be used.
# What effects do you want to play around the player when they throw a catch capsule?
throw-effects:
  # Do you want to use throw effects below?
  use-throw-effects: true
  # Particle to play on the player

#     Mob Catching Behaviour     #
##################################
# Do you want baby mobs to be caught?
catch-baby-mobs: true
# Do you want sheared mobs to be caught?
# Example: sheep.
catch-sheared-mobs: true
# Do you want tamed mobs to be caught? (These mobs can be caught by everyone, it is best to keep this false to avoid pet theft)
# Example: wolf, cat, donkey, horse, llama, parrot, mule, etc.
catch-tamed-mobs: false
# Whether you want the value 'catch-tamed-mobs' above to be ignored for camels.
# As camels are always counted as tamed, having 'catch-tamed-mobs: false' will result in camels being un-catchable. Set this value to true to avoid this issue.
ignore-catch-tamed-mobs-value-for-camels: true
# Do you want mobs that have been named with a name tag or anvil to be caught?
catch-named-mobs: true
# If the above is set to 'true', do you want named mobs to keep their names?
# If this value is set to 'false' the name will be removed.
named-mobs-keep-name: true
# Do you want to save the data of a mob to the mob spawn egg that drops?
# This is found in each mob file under mobs.yml 'egg.egg-data.data-tags'
# Example: sheep colour, villager professions, angry bees, sheared sheep, etc.
# The data that is saved can be edited for each mob individually in their mob file.
save-mob-data: true
# If this value is set to 'true', all data that is normally saved to the final spawn egg will be removed before the spawn egg is given.
# Having this set as 'true' will give players a spawn egg with the hidden spawn egg tags and entity data tags removed.
# If 'true' is set below, these features will be disabled: entity data-tagged mob spawning, custom spawn egg item.
# To make spawn eggs a vanilla spawn egg, set 'save-mob-data' above to false.
